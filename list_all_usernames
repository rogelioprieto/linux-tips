The local user information is stored in: ```/etc/passwd```

´´´less /etc/passwd´´´

This will show the columns:
    -username
    -Password encrypted (A ‘x‘ in this field denotes the password is encrypted and saved in the /etc/shadow file..
    -UID
    -GID
    -GECOS (Full name user)
    -User home directory
    -Shell (by default ```/bin/bash```)
    
    

To display only the first colum, try this ```awk``` script:

´´´awk -F: '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd´´´
