# How to do exit an ssh connection?

There are two ways:

1. _Normal_ way. Closing the shell session will usually exit, for example:
with the shell builtin command, `exit`, followed by `Enter`, or `Ctrl+d`, (end-of-file).

2. This way is used  in the case where you have a bad connection and the shell is unresponsive (or due to inactivity), hit the `Enter` key, then type `~.` and ssh should immediately close and return you to your command prompt.

**Note:** 

- In Ubuntu using windows keyboards `~` is get by pressing `Alt+Ã±` (spanish layout).

- In MacOS on U.S. International - PC layout, press `Alt+N` and then `Space`.

- In Ubuntu, hold down together: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `u` then a nderlined u letter should appear.  Release keys. Enter `7E`(Unicode for ~), press `space` or `Enter`.
