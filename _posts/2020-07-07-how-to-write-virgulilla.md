## Problem: 

I need to write a virgulilla (`~`) but I don't know how to do it. 

## Solution:
You can write the virgulilla (`~`), it doesn't matter if your keyboard layout is Spanish or another's language

### Step by step:

Use any of these ways:

- In Ubuntu using windows keyboards, press `Alt+ñ` (Spanish layout).

- In macOS on U.S. International - PC layout, press `Alt+N` and then `Space`.

- In Ubuntu, hold down together: `Alt Gr` + `4`.

- In Ubuntu, hold down together: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `u` then a underlined u letter should appear.  Release keys. Enter `7E`(Unicode for ~), press `space` or `Enter`.
