title: How to delete fonts in Ubuntu or Ubuntu MATE
categories: linux fonts

## Problem: 

I can view the fonts in Ubuntu MATE but I can't delete them using the default app `MATE font viewer`.

## Solution:
To solve it, we'll use a GUI app. You can install and use the default font manager used in Ubuntu: `Font Manager`.

### Step by step:

1. This step is only for Ubuntu MATE. Open the Terminal and install the app. Type:
    ```bash 
    sudo apt-get install font-manager
    ```
    Close the Terminal.

2. Open the app, typing Super key (window key) type `font manager`
3. Inside the app, search and select the font and delete it!
