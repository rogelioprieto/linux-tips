## Problem: 

I have installed a sound card, but I can't sound any sound, or I hear sound but no not in all speakers.

## Solution:
To solve it, try first to review if your volume for all speakers is right.

### Step by step:

1. Open a `Terminal` and open `alsamixer`\

    If you need to install `alsamixer`, you can type:\
    `sudo apt-get install alsa-utils`

2. You can use `F6` to choose your sound card. Set volume for all speakers.
