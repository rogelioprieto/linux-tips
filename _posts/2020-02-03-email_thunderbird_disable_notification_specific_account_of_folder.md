# Thunderbird - disable new message popup notification for specific account, sender or folder

## Problem:

You have 2 or more accounts in Thunderbird. You want to receive notification only for one of them.

Thunderbird just allow you to enable or disable notification (for all accounts). If you need this, just go to `Edit`-> `Preferences`  and disable `Show an alert`. Disable `Play a sound` too. This will disable notifications for *all* accounts. 

Instead if you need disable notifications only for ONE account, read the **Solution** section.


## Solution:
Install a Thunderbird extension.

### Step by step:
Install `Mailbox Alert` extension. In Thunderbird choose `Tools` -> `Add ons`. Search `Mailbox Alert` in the textbox (located up-right).
