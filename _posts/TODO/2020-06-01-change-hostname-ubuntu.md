hostnamectl set-hostname new_host_name

You need to change the hostname because you don't like it

## What is a hostname in Linux?

A hostname is a name assigned to a “host”  i.e. a computer on a network. The hostname is basically just your computer’s name. It’s used to identify your computer on the network.
