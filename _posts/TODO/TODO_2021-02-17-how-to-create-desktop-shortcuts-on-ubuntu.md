##Problem: 
I have installed a program or software but doesn't apears in launch bar (or launch menu).

## Solution:
1. Create a new .desktop file. In an editor, type:
```bash
[Desktop Entry]

Comment=EqualX is just a graphical interface to latex and a bunch of conversion programs for aiding you write equations faster in latex and generate export files to use them in other applications.
Exec=/usr/bin/equalx
Path=/home/rogelioprieto
Icon=/home/rogelioprieto/Downloads/equalx_logo.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application

```
