# How to Mount Physical USB Devices in a VirtualBox VM

## Problem:
Have you tried attaching a USB device to your VirtualBox virtual machine (VM) only to have it not show up as recognized? This is actually a very common issue and one that plagued me when I first started using VirtualBox. 

## Troubleshooting

Still not working? Try installing the Virtualbox Extension Pack (the same version as your Virtual Box). 

1. Just download it from Oracle and then run it to let Virtualbox automatically add it.

You may need to restart the computer and/or the virtual machine before the mounted USB device will work.
