After looking out many resources in online and spending a lot of time and finding solution through a wild guess I decided to write it myself here for the benefit of people who look for this.

Steps:

    First shutdown your PC
    There is a small button below your charging slot in your laptop, pin it till the screen gets on or you can follow other procedure to enter BIOS mode(check youtube videos)
    Now from the menu select BIOS mode
    Go to Configuration tab and select AMD SVM Support and enable it
    save and exit
    PC will restart and youâ€™re done!
