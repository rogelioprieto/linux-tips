## Problem: 

When you connect an exFAT drive is mounted as read-only in Windows 7; so you can't write in this drive.

## Solution:
To solve it, you can make use of Windows ```Diskpart``` and check the disk using ```chkdsk``` command.

### Step by step:

1. Open CMD prompt, type ```windows+r```, then ```cmd```.  
2. Type in the command as the following:  
(Note: ```N``` refers the volume number of the read-only disk)

```
diskpart
list volume

select volume N 
att vol clear readonly
```

3. Check your disk/drive using chkdsk.
 
Besides, you can run ```chkdsk X: /F``` in cmd.exe or run the GUI based scan by right-clicking on the exFAT partitioned drive and selecting ```Properties-> Tools``` and running the ```Scan``` disk tool. The exFAT partition needs the scan to be done to reset it back to read/write capable.
