## Problem:

I need to modify (delete, insert, etc) text or an element in a pdf file.

What software or application do you recommends?

## Solution:
There are many software to view and edit. I recommend these three:  
- [LibreOffice Draw](https://www.libreofficehelp.com/create-your-first-drawing-using-libreoffice-draw/),  already installed in Ubuntu and another distributions.

- [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/)

- [Okular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okular) (this one only for add comments with annotating tools).

### Step by step:
