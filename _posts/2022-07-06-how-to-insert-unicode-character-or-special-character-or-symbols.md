## Problem: 

You need to type a special character but you can't find it on the keyboard.

## Solution:

You can type the code character (number)to get the character.

### Step by step:

1. Open a Terminal, and press `Ctrl+Alt+T`.  
2. In Ubuntu, hold down together: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `u`. After that, a underlined `uÌ²` letter should appear.  Release keys. Enter the Unicode for the symbol you need. For example: Enter `7E`(Unicode code for `~`), press `space` or `Enter`.

If you need to view the Unicode codes table:\
- [Legacy Entity sets](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/Overview.html#legacysets)\
- [Unicode Character Ranges for Scientific Documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/Overview.html#blocks)
