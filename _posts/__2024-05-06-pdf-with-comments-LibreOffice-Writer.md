Problem:
print pdf but comments aren't not included.

Solution:
Do NOT go to File → Export As → Export as PDF…

Instead, go to File → Print → under the “General” tab, choose “Print to File…” as the Printer → click the “LibreOffice Writer” tab at the top → under the “Comments” dropdown menu, change it from “None (document only)” to “Place in margins” → click “Print to File…” and choose a location to save it.
