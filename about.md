Here I am writing the tips or the solutions to problems I've faced recently as a GNU/Linux user. Some of these solutions I got it while helping to students using GNU/Linux for data science and bioinformatics.

I hope this can help you to save time and learn!

I have been working in computer science since 2002. This website shows the latest solutions from my GNU/Linux  students and by me.
