# Thunderbird sent email problem: "Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent Mail)"


## Problem: 

I'm constantly getting the message "Your message was sent but a copy was not placed in your sent folder (Sent Mail) due to network or file access errors. You can retry or save the message locally to Pastas Locais/Sent Mail-xxxxx@xxxxxxxxxxx.com.

## Solution:

Two things to consider: in the Copies & Folders section for a gmail account in Tools/Account Settings, uncheck 'Place a copy in' since gmail automatically copies sent messages to the Sent folder. Second, disable antivirus scanning of outgoing email, if it's in place.

### Step by step:
In thunderbird, choose your ```email account->Settings...->Copies & Folders```. Uncheck (disable) ```place a copy in:```
